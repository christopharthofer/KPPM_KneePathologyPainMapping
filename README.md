# KPPM_KneePathologyPainMapping
Matlab code for evaluating Voxel-based Knee Pathology-Pain Mapping (KPPM) as described in the publication 'Arthofer et al. (2020) An anatomical atlas of the knee and voxel-based knee pathology-pain mapping'. We implemented two methods, permutation-based thresholding with binary logistic regression and Mann-Whitney testing. Lesion and pain data can be simulated or provided as input.
